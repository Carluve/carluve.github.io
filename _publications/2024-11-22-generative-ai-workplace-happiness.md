> **Publication status:** Presented at **Happiness 2024** and **awaiting publication** in the official conference proceedings.

## Abstract  
The study links the adoption of **generative AI** to **workplace happiness and performance**, analysing evidence from large-scale surveys (e.g. McKinsey, Deloitte, Microsoft) and sector case-studies. Using a *grounded-theory* design, it maps how AI-driven automation, augmentation and new work practices modify employee emotions, productivity metrics and organisational culture.

## Methodology  
* **Data sources:** 30 + consultancy reports and 40 semi-structured interviews across finance, healthcare, tech and manufacturing.  
* **Design:** Constant-comparative coding → tri-stage model of *initial impact*, *adaptation* and *long-term transformation*.  
* **Analysis:** Mixed qualitative–quantitative triangulation, with thematic saturation validated through axial coding.

## Key Findings  
- **Immediate productivity surge** but simultaneous rise in *job-security anxiety* and *ethical concerns*.
- **Adaptation phase:** reskilling programmes and workflow redesign mitigate stress, sustaining performance gains.
- **Long-term outlook:** AI enables continuous learning cultures and improved work–life balance, yet bias and privacy risks persist.
- Unique contribution: positions *happiness management* as a strategic lens for AI deployment.

## Practical Implications  
1. **Transparent communication** and *mental-health support* reduce AI-related stress.  
2. **Continuous training** ensures employees complement, not compete with, AI.  
3. **Human-AI collaboration metrics** should be embedded in HR dashboards to capture well-being alongside output.  
4. Governance frameworks must tackle bias, accountability and data protection to preserve trust.
