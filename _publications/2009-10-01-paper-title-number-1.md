This study provides a comparative evaluation of 22 large language models (LLMs) on the Spanish Medical Intern Resident (MIR) exams for 2024 and 2025. It assesses the ability of generative AI models to demonstrate clinical reasoning, interpret images, and apply epidemiological knowledge.

Key findings include:
- Fine-tuned models like Miri Pro outperform general-purpose LLMs in clinical tasks.
- Multimodal models show superior performance on image-based questions.
- General-purpose LLMs lag in Spain-specific public health scenarios.
- Ethical reasoning remains a challenge for all AI systems evaluated.

The study highlights the need for AI literacy in medical education, domain-specific fine-tuning, and responsible integration of AI into clinical assessment and decision-making.
