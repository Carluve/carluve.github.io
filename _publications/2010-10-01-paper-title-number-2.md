This study explores the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) on workplace happiness and productivity. Drawing from industry surveys and academic references, the paper investigates how generative AI adoption influences employee well-being, operational efficiency, and job satisfaction.

Key findings include:
- Generative AI significantly enhances productivity by automating routine tasks.
- It supports flexibility and work-life balance, improving employee satisfaction.
- Concerns persist around job security, emotional well-being, and ethical implementation.
- A three-stage model is proposed: initial impact, adaptation, and long-term transformation.

The research uses a Grounded Theory methodology, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative data from sources such as McKinsey, Microsoft, and Deloitte. It emphasizes the importance of continuous upskilling, ethical AI adoption, and human-AI collaboration.
