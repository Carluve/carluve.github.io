In this post I’ll walk through how I configured **Cloudflare for Families** on my ASUS router, why I think it’s a good idea, and what each parameter really means. Setting this up is simple, but the benefits for security, privacy and peace of mind are surprisingly strong.

### Summary
Using Cloudflare for Families DNS inside an ASUS router provides a layer of protection against malware and adult content across all devices at home, without installing any software individually.

#### What is Cloudflare for Families?
Cloudflare offers a free DNS service with built-in filtering. Instead of your ISP’s DNS servers, you point your devices (or better, your whole network) to Cloudflare’s servers.  

- **1.1.1.1** is Cloudflare’s fast, private DNS.  
- **1.1.1.2 / 1.0.0.2** block malware.  
- **1.1.1.3 / 1.0.0.3** block malware + adult content.  

By setting this up at router level, every device connected to your Wi-Fi automatically benefits from it.

#### How to Configure on an ASUS Router
Here’s the configuration I applied (screenshot below):

*(Image placeholder: screenshot of ASUS WAN DNS settings with Cloudflare Family DNS enabled)*  

1. **WAN DNS Setting**  
   - Set **DNS Server** manually to `1.1.1.3` and `1.0.0.3`.  
   - This ensures all requests go through Cloudflare’s Family filter.  

2. **Forward local domain queries to upstream DNS** → *Yes*  
   - Lets the router forward even internal lookups to the upstream server, ensuring consistency.  

3. **Enable DNS Rebind Protection** → *Yes*  
   - Blocks malicious responses that try to reroute internal queries to external IPs.  

4. **Enable DNSSEC support & Validate responses** → *Yes*  
   - Adds cryptographic validation that DNS replies haven’t been tampered with.  

5. **Prevent client auto DoH** → *Yes*  
   - Stops clients from bypassing router DNS settings by using their own encrypted DNS.  

6. **DNS Privacy Protocol** → *DNS-over-TLS (DoT)*  
   - Encrypts DNS traffic so your ISP can’t snoop on the sites you’re visiting.  

7. **DNS-over-TLS Profile** → *Strict*  
   - Forces encryption and validation of the DNS server identity.  

8. **Server List**  
   - Added `1.1.1.3` with hostname `family.cloudflare-dns.com`.  
   - Port `853` is the standard for DoT.

#### Benefits I’ve Noticed
- **Peace of mind:** All devices are automatically protected, even IoT gadgets.  
- **Performance:** Cloudflare is fast; I didn’t notice any slowdown.  
- **Security baseline:** DNS filtering won’t block everything, but it cuts down exposure to phishing and shady content.  
- **Parental control without hassle:** Instead of configuring each child’s device, I set it once on the router.

#### My Personal Take
For me, configuring **Cloudflare for Families** was a no-brainer. It’s free, fast, and adds a meaningful extra layer of security and filtering. I like solutions that work at the network edge rather than on each device — they’re easier to maintain and harder to bypass.  

This won’t replace full parental control or endpoint protection, but it’s a very strong starting point. If you have an ASUS router, I highly recommend enabling it.
