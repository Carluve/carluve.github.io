Recently, I explored the **free tier of Cursor**, an AI-powered code editor designed to boost productivity and streamline software development. Cursor offers a modern, VSCode-based experience with integrated AI features for code completion, refactoring, and documentation.

### What is Cursor?
Cursor is a next-generation code editor that leverages artificial intelligence to help developers write, understand, and improve code faster. It integrates seamlessly with popular workflows and supports a wide range of programming languages.

### Free Tier Features
- **AI code completion and suggestions**
- **Basic refactoring tools**
- **Limited daily usage of advanced AI features**
- **Access to community support and updates**

### Limitations
- Daily cap on AI-powered actions (e.g., completions, explanations)
- Some advanced features (like unlimited AI chat or priority support) are reserved for paid plans

### My Experience
The free tier is a great way to try out Cursor's capabilities. For students, hobbyists, or anyone curious about AI-assisted coding, it provides enough functionality to boost productivity without cost. The interface is intuitive, and the AI suggestions are genuinely helpful for both learning and speeding up routine tasks.
