# How to Build Your Own GPT in ChatGPT  
*Step-by-step guide & why the instructions matter*

## 1. Why create a custom GPT?

Creating a GPT lets you bottle up expertise, tone and tooling into a reusable assistant you (or your audience) can summon with one click. Think of it as a **"preset brain"** – perfect for:

* automating repetitive tasks (e.g. proofreading, data analysis)  
* teaching or coaching in a consistent style  
* packaging brand know-how for clients or colleagues  

> **Prerequisites**  
> * ChatGPT Plus or Team plan  
> * A clear goal for what the assistant should achieve  
> * Any reference files, brand guidelines or examples you want it to use  

## 2. Open the GPT builder

1. Sign into **chat.openai.com**.  
2. In the left sidebar, click **Explore GPTs ▸ My GPTs**.  
3. Press **Create a GPT**.

***

You're now in the two-pane builder:

* **Create** – natural-language wizard (great for a quick draft)  
* **Configure** – granular controls (where you'll polish)  

Stay in **Configure** for the rest of this tutorial; it exposes every setting.

## 3. Give your GPT its identity

| Field | What to write | Tips |
|-------|---------------|------|
| **Name** | Short & memorable (e.g. "Prompt Optimiser PRO") | Use Title Case |
| **Icon** | Upload an image or click the emoji button | Consistent branding helps users spot it |
| **Description** | One-sentence elevator pitch | Keep it under 200 chars; appears in searches |

## 4. Craft the **Instructions** – the heart of your GPT 🚀

The **Instructions** box is essentially the GPT's *system prompt*. Everything the assistant says or does flows from here, so invest time to get it right.

### 4.1 Suggested structure

```markdown
# 🧠 Role
You are a…

# 🎯 Objectives
Your mission is to…

# 🎨 Tone & Style
Always write in…

# 🔑 Constraints
Never reveal…

# 🔧 Tools
You may use…

# 🗨️ Conversation flow
At the start, ask…

# ✅ Output format
Respond with…
```

4.2 Best-practice tips
- Be explicit – vague instructions = vague answers.
- Write in the second person ("You are…") so the model adopts the role.
- List do-nots (e.g. "Do not mention OpenAI policy") to fence-in behaviour.
- Include examples of ideal output where formatting matters.
- Iterate – test in the Preview pane, refine, repeat.

## 5. Add knowledge & capabilities

| Setting | Purpose | Typical use-case |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Knowledge** | Upload PDFs, DOCX, CSV, images | Product manuals, research papers |
| **Web Search** | Let the GPT browse in real-time | Market trends, current affairs |
| **Code Interpreter & Data Analysis** | Run Python in-chat | Data cleaning, charting |
| **DALL·E Image Generation** | Create or edit images | Social-media visuals |
| **Canvas** | Collaborative whiteboard | Storyboarding, diagramming |

Toggle only what's genuinely useful – fewer tools = less room for mistakes.

## 6. Provide conversation starters

Seed questions appear on the GPT's landing page and help users grasp its scope.

Good examples:
- "Optimise this paragraph for concision."
- "Generate a LinkedIn carousel outline on AI ethics."

Avoid bland prompts like "Hello" – they waste the user's first message.

⸻

## 7. Test in the Preview pane

The right-hand pane is a live sandbox:
1. Send test prompts typical users will ask.
2. Verify tone, accuracy and formatting.
3. If it drifts, tweak your Instructions and test again.

⸻

## 8. Choose a sharing option

## 9. Maintain & iterate
- Version notes – describe changes before hitting Update.
- Monitor feedback – track chats & ratings in My GPTs.
- Refresh knowledge – replace outdated PDFs, tweak examples.

Treat your GPT like software: patch bugs, refine UX, and keep content current.

⸻

## 10. Key takeaways
1. Instructions are everything – clarity here means quality everywhere.
2. Keep the user's goal front-and-centre; strip anything superfluous.
3. Start small: one solid capability beats five half-baked ones.
4. Test ruthlessly and update often.
