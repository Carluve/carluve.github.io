I recently deployed a small demo app using **Cloudflare Workers** at  
👉 **[https://cloudflare.carlosluengo.es](https://cloudflare.carlosluengo.es)**  
and the experience reminded me why I enjoy building on this platform: it’s fast, global, minimalistic, and opinionated in the right ways.

Here’s my personal take on what Workers are, how they work, how to use them, and where they shine (or don’t).

## What Cloudflare Workers Are (In Practical Terms)

Cloudflare Workers let you deploy serverless code that runs **directly on Cloudflare’s global edge network**—not in a central region. They run inside **V8 isolates**, meaning:

- very low cold-start times  
- tight resource constraints  
- high performance for I/O-heavy workloads  
- strong sandboxing

Instead of provisioning containers or servers, you ship a tiny script and Cloudflare distributes it globally within seconds.

In short:

> **Workers = globally replicated functions with built-in scale, CDN, and smart routing.**

## My Demo App (Deployed on Workers)

I built a tiny interactive demo hosted here:

👉 **[https://cloudflare.carlosluengo.es](https://cloudflare.carlosluengo.es)**

It’s powered entirely by:

- **Workers** (backend logic)
- **R2** (static assets + small image files)
- A very lightweight routing layer
- Edge-powered request handling

Everything deploys instantly via **Wrangler**, including config, bindings, and code updates.

This small project is enough to showcase the full lifecycle: development, storage binding, deployment, and observability.

## How Workers Actually Execute Your Code

When a request hits your domain:

1. Cloudflare routes it to the *nearest* data center.  
2. The Worker executes inside a V8 isolate.  
3. Your code can:
   - inspect the request  
   - run logic  
   - fetch external APIs  
   - read/write storage (KV, R2, Durable Objects)  
4. You return a `Response()` object, just like the Web Fetch API.

No containers, no cold Alpine images downloading, no region selection.

The mental model is simply:

```text
Request → Worker → Response
```

And it runs globally, everywhere, by default.

## Building a Worker: My Minimal Example

Here’s a simplified version of the logic behind my demo:

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);

    if (url.pathname === "/api/hello") {
      return Response.json({
        message: "Hello from the edge 👋",
        url: request.url,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      });
    }

    if (url.pathname === "/logo") {
      const file = await env.MY_BUCKET.get("small_logo.png");
      if (!file) return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
      return new Response(file.body, { headers: { "Content-Type": "image/png" } });
    }

    return new Response("Demo running on Cloudflare Workers 🚀", { status: 200 });
  },
};
```

This illustrates three patterns I use often:
- simple routing
- JSON APIs
- static asset delivery from R2

## How I Deploy (Wrangler Workflow)

This is the exact workflow I used to deploy the demo:

1. **Login & init**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   npx wrangler init demo-app
   ```

2. **Configure the Worker**

   `wrangler.toml` example:

   ```toml
   name = "nationalbank"
   main = "src/index.ts"
   compatibility_date = "2024-11-26"

   [[r2_buckets]]
   binding = "MY_BUCKET"
   bucket_name = "my_bucket"
   ```

3. **Deploy**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

Within seconds, you get a global URL plus optional custom domain—in my case: `cloudflare.carlosluengo.es`

## When Workers Work Extremely Well

From hands-on experience:

✅ **1. Edge logic**  
Routing, headers, transforms, auth, redirects. Milliseconds saved at global scale.

✅ **2. Lightweight APIs**  
Perfect for JSON endpoints or microservices.

✅ **3. Multi-region performance without multi-region complexity**  
Users hit the nearest PoP automatically.

✅ **4. Reliable + reproducible deployments**  
All versions appear in the dashboard; rollback is trivial.

✅ **5. Excellent integration with Cloudflare storage**  
KV for config → super fast  
R2 for files → S3-like  
Durable Objects → state when you need it

## My Overall View After Deploying the Demo

Workers force you to write small, fast, global-first applications.

This constraint is actually liberating.

You stop thinking in terms of regions, clusters, or scaling groups. You focus on:
- handling requests
- composing APIs
- stitching edge logic
- holding small amounts of state where needed

For micro-APIs, edge utilities, and small apps like my demo, Workers are an elegant solution.

For heavy compute or ecosystem-specific libraries, it’s not the right tool—and that’s okay.

---

## Final Thought

If you want to experience “global-first development” for yourself, deploy a 20-line Worker, point a domain at it, and watch it go live everywhere instantly.

That moment—the first request hitting a Worker running close to you—is what sold me.
