## Custom "GPTs"  

Since late 2023, you can create and share your own GPTs—specialised versions of ChatGPT that combine instructions, knowledge, and external tools.  

### How to explore them  
- Open the **Explore GPTs** panel and browse through categories like "Writing", "Productivity", and "Education".  
- Try public GPTs or duplicate one to customise it for your own needs.  
- Add your own data (e.g., an internal guide) so your GPT can respond with tailored expertise.
