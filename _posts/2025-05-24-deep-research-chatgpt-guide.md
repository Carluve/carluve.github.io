## What Do We Mean by “Deep Research”?
Deep research goes beyond a quick skim of search-engine snippets. It is a **structured, multi-stage process** designed to:

- formulate precise research questions,
- retrieve **comprehensive, high-quality** sources,
- critically appraise evidence, and
- synthesise findings into a coherent narrative.

Think of it as moving from the **surface web** to the **substance layer**—where context, nuance, and original data live.

## Why Deep Research Matters in the Age of AI

1. **Information Overload** – Estimates suggest that over 300 million pages are added to the web every day. Without a disciplined approach, signal is drowned by noise.
2. **Misinformation Risks** – Automated content generation has made it easier for unverified material to circulate.
3. **Competitive Advantage** – Teams who *master* deep research spot insights sooner and make better-informed decisions.
4. **Intellectual Integrity** – Proper citation and source analysis uphold ethical standards and build trust.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Problem Definition
Spend time crafting a research question that is **specific, measurable, and bounded**. A clear scope prevents rabbit holes.

### 2. Query Engineering
Leverage advanced search operators (e.g. `site:`, `filetype:`, quotes) and recency or domain filters. ChatGPT's `search_query` tool can embed these parameters programmatically.

### 3. Toolchain Awareness
Deep research is rarely a single-tool affair. Typical components include:

| Need                  | Suggested OpenAI Tool      | Example                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Rapid literature scan | `web.run` – `search_query`| Identify peer-reviewed studies from 2024-2025 |
| Critical appraisal    | Chat analysis prompts      | Compare methodologies                     |
| Data extraction       | `python_user_visible`      | Parse CSV figures                         |
| Visual synthesis      | `image_gen`               | Create conceptual diagrams                |

### 4. Source Evaluation
Apply a checklist such as **CRAAP** (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose) or **RAVEN** (Reputation, Ability to observe, Vested interest, Expertise, Neutrality).

### 5. Iterative Synthesis
Alternate between **divergent searching** (broadening) and **convergent summarisation** (narrowing) until the answer is robust.

## A Step-by-Step Workflow with ChatGPT

1. **Clarify the Objective**  
   *Prompt:* *"In one sentence, what decision will this research inform?"*
2. **Map Sub-questions**  
   Draft a mind-map or list of granular queries.
3. **Design Targeted Searches**  
   Use `web.run` with structured parameters:
   ```json
   {
     "search_query": [{
       "q": "impact of transformer models on protein folding research",
       "recency": 365,
       "domains": ["nature.com", "science.org"]
     }]
   }
   ```
4. **Collect & Cite Sources**  
   Save reference IDs (e.g. `turn3search4`) immediately; they become your formal citations.
5. **Critically Appraise**  
   Ask ChatGPT to compare samples, highlight limitations, or request methodological tables.
6. **Extract Data Programmatically**  
   When numerical tables appear, load them via `python_user_visible` to compute statistics.
7. **Synthesise Findings**  
   Prompt ChatGPT to draft an executive summary; refine iteratively.
8. **Produce Final Artefacts**  
   Convert notes into reports, slide decks, or knowledge-base articles.

## Advanced Techniques

| Technique             | Benefit                        | Example Prompt                                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Recency Filtering** | Focus on the latest evidence  | `recency":30` for last-month material               |
| **Domain Whitelisting** | Cut noise by restricting to trusted sites | `domains":["who.int"]`                  |
| **Multilingual Search** | Access diverse perspectives  | "Translate the query into Japanese and Spanish, then search" |
| **Image Query**       | Retrieve visual data (graphs, maps) | `image_query` for "lithium mine satellite photo" |
| **Automated Alerts**  | Stay current on evolving topics | Schedule a weekly `automations` task              |

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

1. **One-and-Done Searching** – Iterate; the first query is rarely perfect.
2. **Citation Drift** – Always attach the reference ID when the result appears.
3. **Confirmation Bias** – Deliberately search for disconfirming evidence.
4. **Tool Mis-match** – Use `python` for private analysis, `python_user_visible` for user-facing tables and charts.
5. **Over-summarisation** – Preserve key figures and methodological details; don't compress everything into abstract prose.
