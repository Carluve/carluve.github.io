What if the fastest way to create value with AI isn’t by chasing a single killer app—but by spotting dozens of everyday moments where AI can quietly make life easier?

That’s the approach behind the OpenAI guide *"Identifying and Scaling AI Use Cases"*, based on insights from over 300 deployments and 2 million users. This post breaks down the most practical lessons, ready for teams who want to move from “playing with AI” to *delivering real impact*.

## TL;DR – Use Cases Are Everywhere (If You Know What to Look For)

1. Start with **repetitive tasks**, **skill bottlenecks**, and **ambiguous work**.
2. Teach teams the **6 AI primitives** that unlock productivity across any role.
3. Use a simple **impact/effort matrix** to prioritise use cases that matter.
4. Think beyond single tasks—*map full workflows*.
5. Build a culture where people experiment, test, and share their own use cases.

## Key Principles for Finding Great Use Cases

- **Lead from the top.** Senior sponsorship is key.
- **Start simple.** Avoid over-engineering. Quick wins build momentum.
- **Make it social.** Hackathons, Slack channels, and peer GPTs help spread adoption.

## The 3 Work Areas Where AI Excels

**1. Repetitive, low-value tasks:**
- Writing summaries
- Updating dashboards
- Answering common questions

**2. Skill bottlenecks:**
- Running queries without a data team
- Drafting designs or mockups
- Creating reports without an analyst

**3. Ambiguity blockers:**
- Brainstorming ideas
- Getting unstuck when starting a task
- Structuring complex plans

## The 6 AI Use Case Primitives

These are reusable patterns that work across most teams:

- ✍️ **Content creation** – Emails, documents, campaigns, scripts  
- 🔎 **Research** – Market scans, benchmarks, summaries  
- 💻 **Coding** – SQL, Python, HTML, debugging  
- 📊 **Data analysis** – Trends, harmonisation, visuals  
- 💡 **Ideation & strategy** – Brainstorms, plans, feedback  
- 🤖 **Automation** – Scheduled reports, smart summaries, GPT flows

## Prioritising with Impact vs Effort

Use a simple 2x2 to decide what’s worth scaling:

|               | Low Effort       | High Effort      |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| High Impact   | ✅ Quick Wins     | 🚀 Big Bets       |
| Low Impact    | 🤏 Self-serve     | ❌ Deprioritise   |

Examples:
- **Quick win:** Auto-summarise meetings  
- **Big bet:** Custom multilingual GPT for credit risk  
- **Self-serve:** Personalised SQL queries  
- **Deprioritise:** Replacing tools that already work well

## From Tasks to Workflows

The best users don’t stop at a single task—they link AI across steps:

**Example: Marketing Campaign Flow**
1. Research trends → 2. Analyse audience data → 3. Brainstorm ideas → 4. Create assets → 5. Automate localisation

## Building AI Culture

Great AI rollouts aren’t just technical—they’re cultural:

- Run hackathons or "use case olympics"
- Create GPT labs like Estée Lauder’s cross-functional teams
- Set up shared spaces for ideas, templates, and prompts

## My Take

This guide is gold for teams trying to make AI useful *today*. The "6 primitives" idea is so practical—it turns vague possibilities into tangible action. If you want to democratise AI inside your org, this is the playbook.
