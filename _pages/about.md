Hi there! 👋

I'm a PhD candidate and AI enthusiast with a passion for applying cutting-edge technology to real-world challenges—especially in education and the public sector. By day, I help governments and institutions innovate with AI and cloud at Amazon Web Services. By night, I explore the messy, fascinating world of generative models, digital policy, and sometimes... memes.

Previously, I worked across tech giants and innovation teams (Telefónica, Lenovo, Microsoft), always keeping one eye on impact and the other on what's next.

When I’m not coding, presenting, or reading obscure regulation docs, you’ll probably find me:

🚴 biking through Madrid and beyond, always chasing new horizons, 🌍 chasing new cities to explore, or 🎙️ sharing thoughts on AI, tech, and the future of learning.

This site is my digital notebook — ideas, projects, papers, and a bit of chaos. Welcome!
